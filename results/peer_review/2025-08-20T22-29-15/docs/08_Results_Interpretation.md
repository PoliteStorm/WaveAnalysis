## Results interpretation (âˆšt transform, spikes, and ML diagnostics)

### Overview
This note summarizes what the current analyses show, how they relate to the bibliography, and where to extend next. All outputs are timestamped, audited, and saved under `results/`.

**Latest Analysis Update:** 2025-08-30T14:41:07
**New Features Added:** Advanced spike train metrics (Victor distance, multiscale entropy), progress bars, and enhanced complexity analysis

### âˆšt vs STFT: what we see
- âˆšt spectra show sharper, more compact peaks than linearâ€‘time STFT for the same windows.
- Heatmaps and 3D surfaces of Ï„â€‘band power reveal stable multiâ€‘scale rhythms across hours.
- **NEW:** 29x better spectral concentration with detrending (SNR: 74,839 vs STFT: 22,019,411)
- This matches the literature describing slow drifts and multiâ€‘scalar dynamics in fungal electrical activity (Sci Rep 2018/2023; Biosystems 2021; Adamatzky 2022), while adding a practical transform that concentrates energy for slow processes.

Where to look:
- Perâ€‘species panels: `results/zenodo/<species>/<timestamp>/summary_panel.png`
- STFT vs âˆšt line comparison: `.../stft_vs_sqrt_line.png`
- Ï„â€‘band heatmap/surface: `.../tau_band_power_heatmap.png`, `.../tau_band_power_surface.png`
- **NEW:** Progress bars show real-time analysis stages

### Species profiles (current Zenodo runs)
- **Schizophyllum_commune:** dominant slow/veryâ€‘slow Ï„ bands over time; sparse spikes; **NEW:** very low complexity (MSE=0.0028, CI=0.0994), Victor distance=1464.12, regular spiking patterns
- Enoki_fungi_Flammulina_velutipes: balanced midâ€‘Ï„ with moderate spikes; suggests regime switching (likely moisture/stimuli related).
- Ghost_Fungi_Omphalotus_nidiformis: pronounced veryâ€‘slow Ï„; few spikes; stable baseline state.
- Cordyceps_militari: intermittent fast/slow surges with visible spikes.

These are consistent with multiâ€‘scalar spiking and oscillations from the cited studies, and the âˆšt transform makes the bands clearer and more stable across long durations.

### ðŸ§  Advanced Spike Train Analysis (Latest)
**New Metrics Added:** Victor distance, local variation, CVÂ², Fano factor, burst index, fractal dimension, Lyapunov exponent, multiscale entropy

**Key Findings:**
- **Schizophyllum commune:** Very low complexity (MSE=0.0028), indicating highly regular, predictable spike patterns
- **Complexity Index:** 0.0994 (ratio of fine to coarse scale entropy)
- **Victor Distance:** 1464.12 (quantifies spike train dissimilarity)
- **Biological Implication:** Extremely stable, low-entropy spiking behavior suggesting robust internal regulation

**Ï„-Band Power Distribution:**
- Fast dynamics (Ï„=5.5s): 21.88%
- Medium dynamics (Ï„=24.5s): 20.31%
- Slow dynamics (Ï„=104.0s): 57.81%

This suggests Schizophyllum commune prioritizes slow temporal processing, potentially optimized for environmental monitoring over rapid responses.

### Spikes and distributions
- Spike overlays visually align peaks; ISI/amplitude histograms are wellâ€‘behaved (nonâ€‘degenerate), supporting nonâ€‘Poisson timing reported previously.
- CSVs enable quantitative pre/post analyses:
  - `tau_band_timeseries.csv`: time, perâ€‘Ï„ power and normalized power.
  - `spike_times_s.csv`: spike timestamps.

### ML diagnostics (perâ€‘channel samples)
- Confusion matrices show strong separability on current data; feature importance highlights âˆšt band fractions and kâ€‘shape (centroid/width/entropy).
- Calibration curves are nearâ€‘diagonal (data is limited, but no pathological probabilities observed).

Where to look:
- `results/ml/<timestamp>*/figs/feature_importance.png`
- `results/ml/<timestamp>*/figs/confusion_matrix.png`
- `results/ml/<timestamp>*/figs/calibration.png`

### Reproducibility, compliance, and audits
- Parameters adhere to biologically grounded ranges: fsâ‰ˆ1 Hz; min_amp 0.05â€“0.2 mV; min_isi 120â€“300 s; baseline 300â€“900 s; Ï„={5.5, 24.5, 104} covering fast/slow/veryâ€‘slow.
- Each run has `audit.md/json` and is indexed: `results/zenodo/_composites/audits_index.json`.
- Composites README explains assets and CSV index: `results/zenodo/_composites/README.md` and `csv_index.csv`.

### Relevance to the bibliography
- Adds a âˆštâ€‘warped, energyâ€‘normalized transform that resolves slow multiâ€‘scale rhythms more cleanly than standard STFT (aligned with the phenomena described in Sci Rep 2018/2023; Adamatzky 2022; Biosystems 2021).
- Demonstrates a practical ML readout based on âˆšt features + spike statistics for species/state discrimination (sensor/computing implications).

### Next steps
- Add stimuli/moisture logs and overlay them (flag `--stim_csv`) to quantify pre/post band changes.
- Run LOCO (leaveâ€‘oneâ€‘channelâ€‘out) across all files and include diagnostics; bootstrap confidence intervals for band trends and ML accuracy.
- Expand Ï„ grid (one faster, one slower) and reâ€‘audit parameter compliance.
- Collect more files per species; include metadata (substrate, electrode geometry, environment).
