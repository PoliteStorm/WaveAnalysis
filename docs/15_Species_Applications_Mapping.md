Title: "Species Patterns → Applications Mapping"
Date: "2025-08-31"
---

## Purpose
Quick reference linking observed electrophysiology/audio patterns to suggested sensing/computation applications.

## Mapping
- Cordyceps militaris
  - Patterns: fast transients, high CCA (≈0.94), responsive dynamics
  - Suggested: event detection, rapid perturbation sensing, stimulus-response assays

- Flammulina velutipes (Enoki)
  - Patterns: rhythmic mid-scale structure, moderate CCA (≈0.73)
  - Suggested: ambient stability monitoring, baseline drift tracking, low-variance environments

- Omphalotus nidiformis (Ghost)
  - Patterns: coherent slow dynamics, strong CCA (≈0.86–0.74)
  - Suggested: long-horizon environmental health, gradual change detection, load/strain sensing

- Schizophyllum commune
  - Patterns: multi-scale signatures, high CCA (≈0.94, 0.71)
  - Suggested: heterogeneous pattern recognition, network mapping, multi-sensor fusion hub

## Notes
- Increase permutation iterations (≥200) for definitive p-values.
- Extend to more species as data becomes available.
