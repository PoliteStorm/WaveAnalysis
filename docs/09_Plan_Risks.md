# 12–18 month plan, milestones, and risks

## Aims
- Quantify advantages of √t vs. strong baselines (multitaper, reassignment, synchrosqueezing)
- Establish robust τ-band and spike fingerprints across species and conditions
- Deliver sensing prototypes and ML classifiers with calibration and uncertainty

## Milestones
- M1 (Month 3): Baselines integrated; bootstrap CIs for τ-fractions, spike rates, concentration; ablations/controls
- M2 (Month 6): Expanded dataset + metadata; LOFO/LOCO CV results; preregistration of analyses
- M3 (Month 9): Manuscript submission; preprint and code DOI; public figures and press kit
- M4 (Month 12–18): Stimuli experiments; classifier calibration; field validation; grant deliverables

## Risks and mitigations
- Effect sizes shrink on new data → Expand τ grid; tune windows; add multitaper; preregister thresholds
- Nonstationarity confounds → Stimuli logs; phase-randomized controls; channel/file CV
- Small-N generalization → Bootstrap CIs; uncertainty reporting; gather replicates; simple models
