Subject: Collaboration/feedback on √t-transformed fungal electrophysiology fingerprints

Dear Prof. Adamatzky,

My name is Joe Knowles. I’ve developed a square-root time (√t) transform pipeline for long fungal bioelectric recordings that concentrates slow rhythms versus STFT and yields interpretable τ-band fingerprints and ML features. On the public Zenodo dataset (record 5790768), it differentiates Schizophyllum commune, Flammulina velutipes, Omphalotus nidiformis, and Cordyceps militari with clear slow/very-slow profiles and consistent spike regimes.

I would value your feedback on:
- Benchmarking against strong baselines (multitaper, reassignment, synchrosqueezing)
- Experimental design and stimuli/logging to validate band shifts and spike modulation
- Opportunities to expand the dataset and pursue sensing applications

I’ve prepared a one-page overview, a short preprint draft, and a press kit with figures. I’d be happy to share them and a brief live walkthrough.

Best regards,
Joe Knowles
