Subject: Collaboration on √t-transformed fungal electrophysiology fingerprints

Dear [Prof./Dr. Lastname],

I’ve developed a square-root time (√t) transform pipeline for long fungal bioelectric recordings that concentrates slow rhythms vs STFT and yields interpretable τ-band fingerprints and ML features. On Zenodo dataset 5790768, it differentiates four species with clear slow/very-slow profiles.

I’d value your feedback and potential collaboration on benchmarking (multitaper/synchrosqueezing), experimental design (stimuli/logging), and expanded datasets. I can share a one-page overview, preprint draft, and figures.

Warm regards,
