Subject: Visual “fingerprints” of mushroom electricity using a new √t transform

Hi [Name],

I’ve created vivid visual fingerprints and simple metrics for mushroom electricity by applying a square-root time (√t) transform that clarifies slow rhythms usually buried in long recordings. The images show species-specific patterns and could aid sensing and classification.

Happy to share a press kit with hero images, a lay summary, and a one-page explainer.

Thanks,
