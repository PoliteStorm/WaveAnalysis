Subject: Inquiry: √t transform for fungal electrophysiology — suitable for RSOS?

Dear Editor,

I’m writing to ask whether my manuscript on a square-root time (√t) transform for fungal bioelectric analysis would be a good fit for Royal Society Open Science. The method concentrates slow, multiscale rhythms more cleanly than STFT, enabling τ-band fingerprints and machine-learning features across species using public Zenodo data.

If this aligns with RSOS scope, I’d appreciate guidance on recommended article type and any presubmission requirements. I can share a preprint and a one-page overview on request.

Best regards,
