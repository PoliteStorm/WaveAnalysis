Subject: Submission: Concentrating multiscale fungal bioelectric rhythms with a √t transform

Dear Editors,

Please consider our manuscript, “Concentrating multiscale fungal bioelectric rhythms with a square-root time transform enables species fingerprints and ML readouts,” for publication in Royal Society Open Science.

The work analyzes public, long-duration fungal bioelectric recordings using a √t (square-root time) transform that concentrates slow rhythms compared to STFT, yielding clear τ-band fractions, k-shape features, and improved concentration metrics. We pair these with spike statistics to produce species fingerprints and machine-learning readouts across four species. Outputs are fully timestamped and reproducible.

Novelty and significance:
- Introduces a practical √t transform lens for fungal electrophysiology and shows higher concentration than STFT across species.
- Provides interpretable features and visual fingerprints suitable for sensing and classification.
- Aligns with literature on species-specific spiking and multihour oscillations while adding a reproducible pipeline and cross-species diagnostics.

Data and code availability: All results are included in the submission package; raw data are from Zenodo record 5790768.

Conflicts of interest: None declared.
